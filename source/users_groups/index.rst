Users and groups
================

While Clevertim CRM can be used in Solo mode by a single user, its power becomes more obvious when used in a team of users, who share contacts and sales opportunities and work together for closing sales or for handling the communication with potential or existing customers.

Clevertim CRM allows administrators to invite more users, create groups of users, set the visibility permissions for various items at group level, set individual editing/data export permissions at user level and so on.


Adding new users
----------------

To add more users to your Clevertim CRM account, you need to invite them from the `Settings/Users & Groups <https://www.clevertim.com/welcome/#users>`_. When you invite an user to join and contribute to Clevertim CRM, the system sends them an email with a link, which is why we ask you to type their name and email address. When they click the link in the invitation email, they will be taken to a form where they can select a password and specify a few more details (e.g. country, timezone, etc.)

To invite a user, just fill the user's name and email address in the form and click the 'Send Invitation' button.

Once the invitation is sent, the user will appear greyed out in the list of users while the registration is pending.

The Resend button on the right allows you to resend the invitation email, in case the user has not received it or lost it. Please advise the users to also check their Junk/Spam folders when looking for the invitation email if they cannot find it. It is possible some systems might categorize as Junk/Spam any emails from senders that are not recognized in the contacts.

The X button on the right allows you to remove this user from the system. For example, if you mistype the email address of the user, you can always remove the incorrect user from the system by clicking the X button and then re-do the invitation to the correct user with the correct email address.

.. warning::

	The Clevertim CRM plan you are on comes with a maximum number of users you can add. If you reach the upper limit, you will not be able to add any more users. Your options are to either replace some existing users with new users (remove existing user and add new user) or you can `upgrade your plan <https://www.clevertim.com/en-gb/small-business-contact-management/>`_.


Your list of users, with their permissions and status (e.g. Account Owner, Administrator) are displayed in the `Settings/Users & Groups <https://www.clevertim.com/welcome/#users>`_ section. The maximum number of users allowed by your plan is also displayed at the top of the section. See below illustration.

Removing users
--------------

When an employee onboarded onto your Clevertim CRM account leaves or someone no longer needs access to Clevertim, you can remove the user from the system. One reason for this might be to reclaim the seat and allocate it to another user in your company, without having to upgrade to a plan that comes with more user seats.

When you remove a user from the system, this will **not** affect any of the notes, contacts or any other items which the respective user have added in the system. All the data will be maintained.

To remove a user from the system, just click on the X button on the right, as per illustration below:

.. image:: /_static/removing_user.png

To avoid any mistakes, a confirmation dialog will be displayed to allow you to confirm once more that you indeed want to remove the user from the system. See confirmation dialog below:

.. image:: /_static/removing_user_confirmation.png


User permissions
----------------

In the `Settings/Users & Groups <https://www.clevertim.com/welcome/#users>`_ section, on the right, you can choose to give your users certain entitlements. 

.. image:: /_static/user_permissions.png

.. warning::
	Only the account owner or the administrators can add/remove users and permissions.

The following roles and entitlements can be selected for your users:

* Is Admin
	- Make the user an administrator. Administrators can see all the data (including private contacts), they can manipulate the Clevertim CRM account in any way, but they cannot delete the account
* Can Edit
	- Allows users to change the data (e.g. change a contact's details, add notes, etc.). Without this permission users can only read the data in Clevertim CRM without being able to contribute directly.
* Can Delete
	- Allows users to delete contacts, companies, opportunities, cases, notes, etc. Deletes in Clevertim CRM can be un-done within 2 weeks, after which, the data is physically deleted.
* Can Export
	- Allows users to export the data to a CSV file. This is a separate permissions that can be taken away from users if there are concerns they might misappropriate some of your data. (e.g. external users, third party contractors, etc.)

The same section allows you to reset the password for certain users, if needed.


Visibility options
------------------

One of the issues you have to think about when creating a Clevertim account is what data should be visible to whom. Do you want every one of your users to be able to see all the data? Do you want to restrict certain contacts or opportunities, cases etc. so that only certain users can see those data?

This section covers the options available to you and since it concerns who can see the data, these are frequently referred to in our documentation as visibility options. There are a few options or models to choose from when choosing how to make your data visible to users.

The first and the simplest model is to make the data available to everyone. There are no restrictions in place and everyone can see every single contact, company, opportunity or case in the system.

Another model is to allow private data. Private data is data that is available to a single users (and to administrators, as administrators can always see all the data in the system). For example, let's say you have two regular users Mike and John. In this model, Mike can only see his own contacts, while John can only see his own contacts. If you add an administrator, say Becky, then she will be able to see both Mike and John's contacts. Becky, as an administrator, will also be able to transfer contacts from Mike to John or vice versa.

You could choose to combine these two models and have both data that is available to everyone and private data, that is available to a single individual user. The private data is usually indicated by a yellow lock icon, while data available to everyone is indicated by a greyed out lock icon. Administrators can change the visibility of items from visible to everyone to private or from private to visible to everyone. Individual users can only make their own private contacts visible to everyone; they cannot make private items that were previously visible to everyone.

If you need to make data available to multiple sets of users, then you need to create groups of users. The way you create groups of users depend on how you want to make the data visible. For example, you might define a group of users called Marketing Users (or Marketing Department) and add your marketers in that group and another group called Sales Users (or Sales Department) and add your sales users in that group. You can then make early stage contacts only available to marketers, while more qualified contacts are only visible to Sales.

In another model, you could choose to group your users based on whether they're internal or external to your organisation. For example, if you use an external company to generate leads, you might allow those users to see certain contacts but not see them anymore once the contacts are being triaged or qualified internally. In that case, you might want to create an Internal Users vs. External Users groups.


Groups
------

A group is made up of a list of users that belong to that group. Groups allow you to control the visibility of contacts, companies, cases and opportunities at group level, rather than individual user level. You can then control the group membership (i.e. who's in what group) to give individual users access to the data.


Adding a new group
------------------

In the `Settings/Users & Groups <https://www.clevertim.com/welcome/#users>`_ section, scroll down to the section titled Groups, type the name of the group you want to create and press the Add group button.

.. image:: /_static/adding_new_group.png

In this example, we're adding a new group called Marketing Users.

Once added, the newly created group will appear in the Groups section, as shown in the screenshot below:

.. image:: /_static/new_group_added.png

If you want to change the name of the group after you have added it, just click on the name of the group:

.. image:: /_static/changing_name_of_group.png

When you click the name of the group, the name becomes editable, you can make the changes and click the tick symbol button to apply the changes:

.. image:: /_static/changing_name_of_group2.png


Adding/Removing users to groups
-------------------------------

Adding new users to the group is just a matter of selecting the user into the group user list. In the illustration below, we're adding a user Jennifer Hammond to a group Marketing Users:

.. image:: /_static/adding_user_to_group.png

Removing a user from a group is done by clicking the X next to the user's name in the group user list. In the illustration below, we're removing a user Jennifer Hammond from a group Marketing Users:

.. image:: /_static/removing_user_from_group.png

Once clicked, the user will disappear from the group user list.

Changes to the group user list will be made as soon as you made them in the list; there is no additional Save button to press to apply the changes.


Deleting a group
----------------

Deleting a group is done by clicking the X symbol on the right.

.. image:: /_static/deleting_a_group.png

A confirmation dialog will be shown, to make sure you have not clicked the X button by accident.

.. image:: /_static/deleting_a_group_confirmation.png

Deleting a group does not delete the users in the group, it just deletes the grouping of those users under the given name. The name of the group will not be available as a selection in the visibility dialogs.

Items that were visible to the given group will no longer be visible to the users of the deleted groups, unless those users are members of another group that gives them visibility to those items. Walking through an example might give you a better idea of how that works.

Let's say we have two groups: Marketing and Sales, with a user Mike in Marketing and a user John who is both in Marketing and Sales. Let's also assume with have a contact Prospect1, which is marked as visible to both Marketing and Sales groups. If we delete the Marketing group, then Prospect1 will only be visible to the Sales group, since the Marketing group no longer exists. In that case, Mike will no longer see Prospect1, while John, being in Sales as well, will continue to see Prospect1.

When a group is deleted, items visible to only that group will revert to be visible to everyone. For example, if Prospect1 is visible only to the Marketing group and the Marketing group is deleted, then Prospect1 will become visible to everyone, including Sales who couldn't see this contact before.
