Users and groups
================

While Clevertim CRM can be used in Solo mode by a single user, its power becomes more obvious when used in a team of users, who share contacts and sales opportunities and work together for closing sales or for handling the communication with potential or existing customers.

Clevertim CRM allows administrators to invite more users, create groups of users, set the visibility permissions for various items at group level, set individual editing/data export permissions at user level and so on.


Adding new users
----------------

To add more users to your Clevertim CRM account, you need to invite them from the `Settings/Users & Groups <https://www.clevertim.com/welcome/#users>`_. When you invite an user to join and contribute to Clevertim CRM, the system sends them an email with a link, which is why we ask you to type their name and email address. When they click the link in the invitation email, they will be taken to a form where they can select a password and specify a few more details (e.g. country, timezone, etc.)

To invite a user, just fill the user's name and email address in the form and click the 'Send Invitation' button.

Once the invitation is sent, the user will appear greyed out in the list of users while the registration is pending.

The Resend button on the right allows you to resend the invitation email, in case the user has not received it or lost it. Please advise the users to also check their Junk/Spam folders when looking for the invitation email if they cannot find it. It is possible some systems might categorize as Junk/Spam any emails from senders that are not recognized in the contacts.

The X button on the right allows you to remove this user from the system. For example, if you mistype the email address of the user, you can always remove the incorrect user from the system by clicking the X button and then re-do the invitation to the correct user with the correct email address.
