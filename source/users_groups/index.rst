Users and groups
================

While Clevertim CRM can be used in Solo mode by a single user, its power becomes more obvious when used in a team of users, who share contacts and sales opportunities and work together for closing sales or for handling the communication with potential or existing customers.

Clevertim CRM allows administrators to invite more users, create groups of users, set the visibility permissions for various items at group level, set individual editing/data export permissions at user level and so on.


Adding new users
----------------

To add more users to your Clevertim CRM account, you need to invite them from the `Settings/Users & Groups <https://www.clevertim.com/welcome/#users>`_. When you invite an user to join and contribute to Clevertim CRM, the system sends them an email with a link, which is why we ask you to type their name and email address. When they click the link in the invitation email, they will be taken to a form where they can select a password and specify a few more details (e.g. country, timezone, etc.)

To invite a user, just fill the user's name and email address in the form and click the 'Send Invitation' button.

Once the invitation is sent, the user will appear greyed out in the list of users while the registration is pending.

The Resend button on the right allows you to resend the invitation email, in case the user has not received it or lost it. Please advise the users to also check their Junk/Spam folders when looking for the invitation email if they cannot find it. It is possible some systems might categorize as Junk/Spam any emails from senders that are not recognized in the contacts.

The X button on the right allows you to remove this user from the system. For example, if you mistype the email address of the user, you can always remove the incorrect user from the system by clicking the X button and then re-do the invitation to the correct user with the correct email address.

.. warning::

	The Clevertim CRM plan you are on comes with a maximum number of users you can add. If you reach the upper limit, you will not be able to add any more users. Your options are to either replace some existing users with new users (remove existing user and add new user) or you can `upgrade your plan <https://www.clevertim.com/en-gb/small-business-contact-management/>`_.


Your list of users, with their permissions and status (e.g. Account Owner, Administrator) are displayed in the `Settings/Users & Groups <https://www.clevertim.com/welcome/#users>`_ section. The maximum number of users allowed by your plan is also displayed at the top of the section. See below illustration.

Removing users
--------------

When an employee onboarded onto your Clevertim CRM account leaves or someone no longer needs access to Clevertim, you can remove the user from the system. One reason for this might be to reclaim the seat and allocate it to another user in your company, without having to upgrade to a plan that comes with more user seats.

When you remove a user from the system, this will **not** affect any of the notes, contacts or any other items which the respective user have added in the system. All the data will be maintained.

To remove a user from the system, just click on the X button on the right, as per illustration below:

To avoid any mistakes, a confirmation dialog will be displayed to allow you to confirm once more that you indeed want to remove the user from the system. See confirmation dialog below:

User permissions
----------------

In the `Settings/Users & Groups <https://www.clevertim.com/welcome/#users>`_ section, on the right, you can choose to give your users certain entitlements.

.. warning::
	Only the account owner or the administrators can add/remove users and permissions.

The following roles and entitlements can be selected for your users:

* Is Admin
	- Make the user an administrator. Administrators can see all the data (including private contacts), they can manipulate the Clevertim CRM account in any way, but they cannot delete the account
* Can Edit
	- Allows users to change the data (e.g. change a contact's details, add notes, etc.). Without this permission users can only read the data in Clevertim CRM without being able to contribute directly.
* Can Delete
	- Allows users to delete contacts, companies, opportunities, cases, notes, etc. Deletes in Clevertim CRM can be un-done within 2 weeks, after which, the data is physically deleted.
* Can Export
	- Allows users to export the data to a CSV file. This is a separate permissions that can be taken away from users if there are concerns they might misappropriate some of your data. (e.g. external users, third party contractors, etc.)

The same section allows you to reset the password for certain users, if needed.
