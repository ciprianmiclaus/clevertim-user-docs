Frequently asked questions (FAQ)
================================

Configuration
-------------

.. rubric:: Can your website be white labeled?

Not at present.

.. rubric:: Can I change the logo and the colors?

The logo displayed in the upper left corner can be changed from the `Settings/Business preferences <https://www.clevertim.com/welcome/#bus-prefs>`_ section. You can upload your own logo to make your Clevertim CRM account more personalized to your business.

We don't currently support changes to the theme or the colors.

.. rubric:: Can I hide certain tabs that I don't want to see?

Yes.

In the `Settings/Business preferences <https://www.clevertim.com/welcome/#bus-prefs>`_, scroll down to the Tabs Configuration section.
There you can choose which tabs are shown and which are not. You can also rename some tabs to something more appropriate.
For example, you could choose to hide the Companies tab if you only work with contacts/people. You could choose to rename Contacts to Patients, if that's more appropriate for your business.

Don't forget to Save the changes by clicking on the 'Save changes' button at the bottom of the page.


.. rubric:: Can I disallow my users from adding any private contacts, companies, cases or opportunities?

Yes.

In the `Settings/Business preferences <https://www.clevertim.com/welcome/#bus-prefs>`_, scroll down to the Business Settings section.
Make sure you deselect the **Allow users to add private contacts, companies, cases and opportunities (not visible to other regular users but admin users can still see them)** option.

Save your changes. Now your users will not get an option to save private items that others cannot see.

(Note: Administrators can always see private items and re-set the visibility to be public - visible to everyone).


.. rubric:: I want my users to be only able to create contacts (or companies, cases or opportunities) only visible to themselves (i.e. private). I want to disallow the option to create items visible to everyone. Is that possible?

Yes.

In the `Settings/Business preferences <https://www.clevertim.com/welcome/#bus-prefs>`_, scroll down to the Business Settings section.
Make sure you select/tick the **Users can add only private contacts, companies, cases and opportunities (not visible to other regular users but admin users can still see them)** option.
Also, make sure you deselect/untick the **Allow users to add contacts, companies, cases and opportunities visible to Everyone (admin users can always do it, irrespective of this setting)** option.

Save your changes.

.. rubric:: I don't want my users to be able to create items visible to everyone, only to people within their own groups. Is that possible?

Yes. This assumes that you have defined groups of users and placed your users into those groups.

In the `Settings/Business preferences <https://www.clevertim.com/welcome/#bus-prefs>`_, scroll down to the Business Settings section.
Make sure you deselect/untick the **Allow users to add contacts, companies, cases and opportunities visible to Everyone (admin users can always do it, irrespective of this setting)** option.

This will stop your users from being able to create items visible to everyone. They can still create items visible to other users in their group(s) and, if you have not disable that option, they can still raise private items (visible only to them and to any administrators).


Data Entry
----------

.. rubric:: Someone made some changes to the data. Can I find out who and what the changes were?

Yes. The "What's New" tab will show you a log of all the changes made and who made them.
You can filter that section by a few criteria available in the "Filter your new activity by" to find what you're looking for.

.. rubric:: Someone inadvertently deleted a contact. Is it possible to recover the contact, its notes and data?

Yes. In the "What's New" tab you will need to find the log entry that shows the delete operation.
Next to it, there should be an (undo) link. Click the undo link in order to recover the contact and its associated data (including notes).

.. rubric:: Can I edit multiple items at the time?

Yes. We'll use the contacts as an example below, but this applies to companies, cases and opportunities too.

In the Contacts tab, select the items you want to update. You can filter the list to narrow down the list of contacts to the ones you want to update.

Once you select multiple contacts, a dropdown control will appear that allows you to select an operation to apply to all the selected contacts.

The **Bulk data updates** operations allow you to set or remove a value for a field. When you select this operation, you will be given an option to select the field you want to update. For example, you could select the Country, in order to update the Country field in bulk for multiple contacts.
Specify the value for the field (e.g. Country) and then click Apply.

The **Bulk tagging** allows you to add/remove tags to multiple contacts at a time.

Other bulk operations available in this section allow you to merge contacts, email or SMS multiple contacts, change visibility for contacts, archive, delete or place contacts into Favourites, Need Love or marking them as needing a follow up.

.. rubric:: Can I merge duplicate contacts?

Sometimes, in a CRM system, you end up with duplicate entries for the same contact or for the same company. In the description below, we assume we're merging contacts, but the same approach applies to merging companies, cases and opportunities.

Merging contacts is achieved in a few steps:
	* Select the contacts you want to merge (the duplicates)
	* Add them to the merge section
	* Perform the merge

To select a contact, go to the Contacts tab and select a contact by clicking the checkbox that appears on the left. In the 'Select operation' dropdown, select the 'Add to merge section' operation and click Apply.

The merge section will appear on the right as soon as you select your first contact to merge and add it to the merge section. It will show you at all times the selected contacts for the merge operation. It has two buttons: Discard, which will discard the merge operation and clear the merge section without performing any merging, and Merge, which will perform the actual merge operation.

Once merged, the old contacts will be deleted, and they will appear in the "What's new section" as deleted and a new contact is created which will contain the merged fields/notes/data of the merge contacts. If you are not happy with the merge, you can always undo the deletes and recover your old contacts.

Note: When the merge contacts contain conflicting values for fields that cannot contain multiple values, then the value from the first contact is used. As such, choosing which contact is your first contact in the merge section is significant to the end result. Fields that can contain multiple values (e.g. emails, websites, notes) are not affected, as all the values are added to the new contact.

.. rubric:: I have some old contacts that I don't need. What are the options?

You can delete the contacts. Deleted contacts are maintained in the system for approximately two weeks, for you to be able to undo the delete operation, if they were deleted by mistake. After that time, they are cleared from the system and you will not be able to recover them.

Another option is to archive the contacts. Archived contacts will not appear in the main list, but are still retained in the system. To un-archive your contacts, please contact our support.
Archived contacts are also viewable in the reports (when you choose the option to include archived contacts in your report).

One other difference between deleting and archiving is that archived contacts are still contributing to your overall number of contacts allowed by your plan. Deleted contacts do not.


Notes
-----

.. rubric:: Can I see the notes added under contacts under their respective companies too?

Yes.

In the `Settings/Business preferences <https://www.clevertim.com/welcome/#bus-prefs>`_ section, you can enable the option **Automatically file contact notes under their respective companies too (changing this setting will affect existing notes too)**. As the name suggests, when this option is enabled, any notes filed under contacts, will be automatically filed under their respective companies (if the contacts have the company field set). Notes filed under companies will remain filed under the company alone - they will not be replicated onto all the contacts within that company.

This is a setting that can be turned on by an administrator; by default it is not enabled.


.. rubric:: Can I file notes under multiple contacts or companies?

Yes.

When you add a note, click on the **More options...** link to expand the additional options. Click on **File under**. This will bring up a dialog box that will allow you to select multiple contacts and/or companies to file the note under. You can also select a single opportunity and/or a single case to also file the note under.

Once a note is added, you can click the **File this** button to bring up the same dialog box that will allow you to move the note to be filed under different contacts, companies, etc. This is a very useful feature when a note has been filed incorrectly under the wrong contact, company, opportunity or case and needs to be moved under the correct resource.

When filed under multiple contacts, companies or under a single opportunity and/or case, the note is shared. It is the same note, so, changing it in one place (under one contact), will also change it under all the other contacts, companies, opportunity or case it is also filed under.


.. rubric:: Can I back date a note to appear as if it was added in the past?

Yes, but only when the note is initially added. Once added, the date of a note cannot be changed.

Sometimes conversations with contacts might not be captured at the time when they actually happen. When those notes are entered into the system, it is desirable to be able to back date them, to reflect the time when the conversations actually took place.

When filing a note, expand the **More options...** section. A button that allows you to choose a date and a time becomes visible. The note will be added 'as of' that time.


Emailing from Clevertim
-----------------------

.. rubric:: In the 'Send an email' tab, I don't see any email addresses in the From dropdown box. Why?

Only validated email addresses can be used to email from. This is to ensure that users can only email from their own email addresses.

To validate your email address, go to the `Settings/Email dropbox <https://www.clevertim.com/welcome/#email-dropbox>`_ where there is a section titled **Your additional email addresses**.
That will allow you to validate your main email address (which you used when you signed up for Clevertim) and also add any more email addresses.
That list of addresses is used to determine which email addresses can be used when emailing from Clevertim and it is also used to determine which email addresses to accept email from to the Email dropbox.

.. rubric:: When I email a contact from Clevertim, who will they see in the From field: me or Clevertim?

The contacts will see the email coming from your own email address, not from a Clevertim email address.
Some email clients might display a 'via Clevertim' next to your email address.
You can select which email address they will see in the From dropdown.

.. rubric:: When a contact replies to an email sent from Clevertim where will that reply go?

Any replies will go to your email address and they will not make their way into Clevertim unless you forward them to your Clevertim dropbox dedicated email address.

.. rubric:: I would like to send emails from a different email address than the one I have registered with for Clevertim. Is that supported?

Yes.

In the `Settings/Email dropbox <https://www.clevertim.com/welcome/#email-dropbox>`_, there is a section titled **Your additional email addresses**. Add your email address there and then make sure you validate it by clicking on the link in the automated validation email you will receive from Clevertim.
You will only be able to email from validated email addresses.

.. rubric:: Can I email multiple contacts in bulk?

Yes.

In the Contacts list view, use the checkbox on the left hand side to select the contacts you want to email in one go.
From the 'Select operation' dropdown, select 'Send bulk email' and fill in the email text.



Sending SMS messages from Clevertim
-----------------------------------

.. rubric:: Why does the 'Send a SMS' section appear greyed out?

In order to send SMS messages from Clevertim you need to enable an SMS integration.
Currently, the only SMS integration we support is with SMS Global, a third party provider. You will need an account with them and credit with them, as the SMS messages will be sent via SMS Global who might charge for messages on some of their plans.

Once you create and fund your SMS Global account, to enable the SMS Global integration, go to `Settings/Applications <https://www.clevertim.com/welcome/#apps>`_ and click Enable on the SMS Global integration.

.. rubric:: When I try to send a SMS, I do not see any phone numbers in the To dropdown box. Why?

The To dropdown box is populated from the 'Phone no' field for the contact. Please make sure that you add a contact's mobile phone number in the 'Phone no' field.
Once added, the To dropdown box will be populated with the phone numbers for the contact (you might have to change tabs back and forth or refresh the page if the phone numbers are not picked up automatically once added).

.. rubric:: Can I send SMS messages to multiple contacts in bulk?

Yes.

In the Contacts list view, use the checkbox on the left hand side to select the contacts you want to email in one go.
From the 'Select operation' dropdown, select 'Send bulk SMS' and fill in the SMS text.
