Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

Notes
-----

.. rubric:: Can I see the notes added under contacts under their respective companies too?

Yes.

In the Settings/Business preferences section, you can enable the option **Automatically file contact notes under their respective companies too (changing this setting will affect existing notes too)**. As the name suggests, when this option is enabled, any notes filed under contacts, will be automatically filed under their respective companies (if the contacts have the company field set). Notes filed under companies will remain filed under the company alone - they will not be replicated onto all the contacts within that company.

This is a setting that can be turned on by an administrator; by default it is not enabled.


.. rubric:: Can I file notes under multiple contacts or companies?

Yes.

When you add a note, click on the **More options...** link to expand the additional options. Click on **File under**. This will bring up a dialog box that will allow you to select multiple contacts and/or companies to file the note under. You can also select a single opportunity and/or a single case to also file the note under.

Once a note is added, you can click the **File this** button to bring up the same dialog box that will allow you to move the note to be filed under different contacts, companies, etc. This is a very useful feature when a note has been filed incorrectly under the wrong contact, company, opportunity or case and needs to be moved under the correct resource.

When filed under multiple contacts, companies or under a single opportunity and/or case, the note is shared. It is the same note, so, changing it in one place (under one contact), will also change it under all the other contacts, companies, opportunity or case it is also filed under.


.. rubric:: Can I back date a note to appear as if it was added in the past?

Yes, but only when the note is initially added. Once added, the date of a note cannot be changed.

Sometimes conversations with contacts might not be captured at the time when they actually happen. When those notes are entered into the system, it is desirable to be able to back date them, to reflect the time when the conversations actually took place.

When filing a note, expand the **More options...** section. A button that allows you to choose a date and a time becomes visible. The note will be added 'as of' that time.
