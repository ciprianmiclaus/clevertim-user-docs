Frequently asked questions (FAQ)
================================

Notes
-----

.. rubric:: Can I see the notes added under contacts under their respective companies too?

Yes.

In the `Settings/Business preferences <https://www.clevertim.com/welcome/#bus-prefs>`_ section, you can enable the option **Automatically file contact notes under their respective companies too (changing this setting will affect existing notes too)**. As the name suggests, when this option is enabled, any notes filed under contacts, will be automatically filed under their respective companies (if the contacts have the company field set). Notes filed under companies will remain filed under the company alone - they will not be replicated onto all the contacts within that company.

This is a setting that can be turned on by an administrator; by default it is not enabled.


.. rubric:: Can I file notes under multiple contacts or companies?

Yes.

When you add a note, click on the **More options...** link to expand the additional options. Click on **File under**. This will bring up a dialog box that will allow you to select multiple contacts and/or companies to file the note under. You can also select a single opportunity and/or a single case to also file the note under.

Once a note is added, you can click the **File this** button to bring up the same dialog box that will allow you to move the note to be filed under different contacts, companies, etc. This is a very useful feature when a note has been filed incorrectly under the wrong contact, company, opportunity or case and needs to be moved under the correct resource.

When filed under multiple contacts, companies or under a single opportunity and/or case, the note is shared. It is the same note, so, changing it in one place (under one contact), will also change it under all the other contacts, companies, opportunity or case it is also filed under.


.. rubric:: Can I back date a note to appear as if it was added in the past?

Yes, but only when the note is initially added. Once added, the date of a note cannot be changed.

Sometimes conversations with contacts might not be captured at the time when they actually happen. When those notes are entered into the system, it is desirable to be able to back date them, to reflect the time when the conversations actually took place.

When filing a note, expand the **More options...** section. A button that allows you to choose a date and a time becomes visible. The note will be added 'as of' that time.


Emailing from Clevertim
-----------------------

.. rubric:: In the 'Send an email' tab, I don't see any email addresses in the From dropdown box. Why?

Only validated email addresses can be used to email from. This is to ensure that users can only email from their own email addresses.

To validate your email address, go to the `Settings/Email dropbox <https://www.clevertim.com/welcome/#email-dropbox>`_ where there is a section titled **Your additional email addresses**.
That will allow you to validate your main email address (which you used when you signed up for Clevertim) and also add any more email addresses.
That list of addresses is used to determine which email addresses can be used when emailing from Clevertim and it is also used to determine which email addresses to accept email from to the Email dropbox.

.. rubric:: When I email a contact from Clevertim, who will they see in the From field: me or Clevertim?

The contacts will see the email coming from your own email address, not from a Clevertim email address.
Some email clients might display a 'via Clevertim' next to your email address.
You can select which email address they will see in the From dropdown.

.. rubric:: When a contact replies to an email sent from Clevertim where will that reply go?

Any replies will go to your email address and they will not make their way into Clevertim unless you forward them to your Clevertim dropbox dedicated email address.

.. rubric:: I would like to send emails from a different email address than the one I have registered with for Clevertim. Is that supported?

Yes.

In the `Settings/Email dropbox <https://www.clevertim.com/welcome/#email-dropbox>`_, there is a section titled **Your additional email addresses**. Add your email address there and then make sure you validate it by clicking on the link in the automated validation email you will receive from Clevertim.
You will only be able to email from validated email addresses.

.. rubric:: Can I email multiple contacts in bulk?

Yes.

In the Contacts list view, use the checkbox on the left hand side to select the contacts you want to email in one go.
From the 'Select operation' dropdown, select 'Send bulk email' and fill in the email text.



Sending SMS messages from Clevertim
-----------------------------------

.. rubric:: Why does the 'Send a SMS' section appear greyed out?

In order to send SMS messages from Clevertim you need to enable an SMS integration.
Currently, the only SMS integration we support is with SMS Global, a third party provider. You will need an account with them and credit with them, as the SMS messages will be sent via SMS Global who might charge for messages on some of their plans.

Once you create and fund your SMS Global account, to enable the SMS Global integration, go to `Settings/Applications <https://www.clevertim.com/welcome/#apps>`_ and click Enable on the SMS Global integration.

.. rubric:: When I try to send a SMS, I do not see any phone numbers in the To dropdown box. Why?

The To dropdown box is populated from the 'Phone no' field for the contact. Please make sure that you add a contact's mobile phone number in the 'Phone no' field.
Once added, the To dropdown box will be populated with the phone numbers for the contact (you might have to change tabs back and forth or refresh the page if the phone numbers are not picked up automatically once added).

.. rubric:: Can I send SMS messages to multiple contacts in bulk?

Yes.

In the Contacts list view, use the checkbox on the left hand side to select the contacts you want to email in one go.
From the 'Select operation' dropdown, select 'Send bulk SMS' and fill in the SMS text.
