Clevertim CRM allows you to upload your contacts in bulk by importing an extract from another system (e.g. ACT!, Gmail, LinkedIn, Outlook, Yahoo)
or by importing generic file formats like CSV or vCard.

If you have your data in Excel or as a google spreadsheet, you can export it as a CSV file and use our CSV upload facility. See: link1_

.. rubric:: Importing cases or opportunities

We don't currently support the automated upload of cases and opportunities, but this is something you need, please contact our support and we can arrange
to import this data for you at no additional cost.
